# SAMP-GPCI-Changer
 SA:MP GPCI Changer for 0.3.7 & 0.3.DL (Retain specific gpci's & switch back and forth)


This GPCI Changer, working for both 0.3.7 & 0.3.DL allows you to change your GPCI to a (random) specific GPCI.
The GPCI will be random but you can identify it by using a set of characters/string so you can go back and forth to the same GPCI.

Command:
/changegpci (no parameters: random gpci)
/changegpci (unique identifier/string)


Takes effect on next restart.
